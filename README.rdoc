# Reports Dashboard for automation results
#Objective:
This dashboard started as a project in my free time. The automation reports we had was in plain html format and viewing the weekly reports was becoming a problem,due to this I came up with this dashboard. It was very well accepted among the team and is hosted internally. The minimal demo version I have hosted on heroku.
The Demo version is accessible on :
